Looking at the services output, I found this message: "failed unmounting /var/lib/docker" Although the reason is quite obvious, the root cause is not so easy to figure out. Also, it&#8217;s one of those scary situations where there&#8217;s simply not enough results [&#8230;]...

Too Many Open Files (2021-06-02)::
If your containers suddenly stop working due to &#8220;Too Many Open Files&#8221;, you can adjust that with the DefaultLimitNOFILE on the SystemD configuration files /etc/systemd/user.conf and /etc/systemd/system.conf.

Projetos interessantes pra acompanhar no universo Kafka (2021-01-19)::
Recentemente um amigo me perguntou sobre alguns projetos interessantes no universo Kafka. E eu separei 3 projetos que eu acompanho, 1 dos quais eu contribuo, e que acho interessantes.
